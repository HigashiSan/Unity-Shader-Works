A real-time volume cloud system.
Use raymarching to sample the density of a 3D worley noise to generate the cloud shape.And sample the density between the light and sample position to calculate the light scatter and attenuation.
Yet there's still a problem has to be solved , I still try to figure out how to do the edge glow for the cloud shading.
